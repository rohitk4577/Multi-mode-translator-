## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* `pip` package manager
* A web browser that supports the Web Speech API (e.g., Chrome, Edge)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd morsecode
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        # For macOS/Linux
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate

        # For Windows
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. This file will store your API key.
    * Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env` file. You can obtain a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    * Run the Flask application:
        ```bash
        flask run
        ```
    The backend server will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    * No special setup is required for the frontend. Simply open the `welcome.html` or `index.html` file in your web browser.
        ```bash
        # (From the root 'morsecode' directory)
        open welcome.html
        ```

---

##  usage

Once the backend is running and you have opened the frontend in your browser:

1.  From the **Welcome Portal**, select the translation mode you wish to use:
    * Translate Languages
    * Encode Morse
    * Decode Morse
2.  This will take you to the main translator interface (`index.html`). You can switch between modes at any time using the tabs at the top.
3.  **Language Translation**: Select source and target languages, type or speak your text, and see the translation appear.
4.  **Morse Encoding/Decoding**: Use the dedicated tabs to convert between English and Morse code. For decoding, you can type the code directly or use the interactive tap pad.
5.  **Toggle Theme**: Use the sun/moon icon at the top-right to switch between light and dark modes.
6.  **View History**: Click the history icon to see a list of your previous language translations.
